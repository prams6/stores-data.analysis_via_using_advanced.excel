Greetings, Respected Person

  Hello, The below Business analysis of the data is on the Vrinda store: which has multiple ecommerce products and these products are been bought by majority of the population contributing to the sales and generating more than the break even point.
  As a business analyst, the data is been browsed and surfed from the perspective to understand the peak points and to evauate those key points to generate more effient desicions leading to awareness in the less active segmented market and hike of revenue.

  <h1><B> DATA MODELLING </B></H1>
  The data was analysed on Excel using advanced tools; Firstly we cleansed the data looking for no duplicates or blank columns, so there are no errors in the furture 
  While there was much understanding about the data, there were two tables; First one being  the table of <B>AGE</B> which had multiple age (numeric or metric value) which would not give a precise statistical calculation and also we had <b>DATE</b> table which we again had to sort efficiently.
  
 <h1><B> DATA PROCESSING </B></H1>
 <p1> <B>BREAKING DOWN INTO METRICS</B></P1>
 
- Categorising the values of the varibale by using <B>[IF FORMULA]</B> in Excel gave a better view and unerstanding of the segment.
- We categorised the data and now have two tables with one being the Age Group Category which we sorted from the age table
- Second; we created the monthly table: through the Date table by using the IF formula
This would make the data more clear, simple to read and accurate during visualising the data.

 <h1><B> DATA ANALYSIS </B></H1>
-To analyse the data; <b>PIVOT TABLE ANALYSIS </b> was the best suitable option to understand the data in the right manner and make desicions which feel exactly right.

To understand the metrics; We formulated a set of questions from the prespective of "HOW" and "WHAT" caused the changes: and below are the following questions and respective answers whch we had found out.

Q1. THE HIGHEST AMOUNT OF SALES AND ORDERS?
Ans: The highest orders were 2900K Orders leading to the sales and revenue generation of amount 2.0 Million

Q2. THE MONTH WHICH HAD THE HIGHEST AMOUNT OF SALES AND ORDERS AND WHICH GENDER SEGMENT CONTRIBUTES THE MOST?
Ans: As we can true the trend analysis , the highest amount of Sales were in the month of March with revenue generation upto 1.95 Million and the more no. of contribution is from the Women side with the <B>PERCENTAGE RATE UPTO 64% </B>

Q3. THE ORDER STATUS: : 92% of the orders are delivered on time, and however the rest 8% holds the cancelled, returned and refunded orders which needs to be addressed aswell

- Through the various questions: We understand for a fact that when we compare the same with the gender and age; we have a clarity on which age and gender contributes the more to the sales:
