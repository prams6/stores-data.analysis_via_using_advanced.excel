 Greetings, Respected Person

Hello,
The below <B>BUSINESS ANALYST</B> is on Vrinda Store, which offers multiple e-commerce products. These products are purchased by a significant portion of the population, contributing to the store's sales and surpassing the break-even point.

As a business analyst, the data has been browsed and analyzed from the perspective of understanding the peak points and evaluating key insights to generate more efficient decisions. This leads to increased awareness in the less active market segments and a rise in overall revenue.


  <h1><B> DATA MODELLING </B></H1>
The data was analyzed in Excel using advanced tools. Firstly, we cleansed the data, ensuring no duplicates or blank columns to avoid errors in the future.
Upon understanding the data, we identified two key tables:

The Age Table, which contained numeric values that would not provide precise statistical calculations unless categorized efficiently.
The Date Table, which required proper sorting for accurate time-based analysis.
  
 <h1><B> DATA PROCESSING </B></H1>
 <p1> <B>BREAKING DOWN INTO METRICS</B></P1>
 
- Categorizing the values of variables using [IF FORMULA] in Excel provided a clearer understanding of different customer segments.
We categorized the data into two key tables:
1. Age Group Category, which was derived from the Age Table.
2. Monthly Table, created from the Date Table using the IF formula.
This improved data clarity, making it simpler to read and more accurate for visualization.

 <h1><B> DATA ANALYSIS </B></H1>
-To analyze the data effectively, Pivot Table Analysis was the best-suited approach. It allowed us to understand key metrics and make informed decisions.

We formulated a set of questions based on "HOW" and "WHAT" caused changes in the data. Below are our findings:

Q1. Which month had the highest sales and order volume?
Ans: The highest orders were 2900K, leading to total sales revenue of ₹2.0 million.

Q2. Which month recorded the highest sales, and which gender segment contributed the most?
Ans:  Based on trend analysis, March saw the highest sales, generating ₹1.95 million in revenue.
- Women contributed 64% of the total sales, making them the primary buyers.

Q3. What is the order status?
Ans: 92% of the orders were delivered on time, while the remaining 8% consisted of canceled, returned, or refunded orders, which need further attention.

By comparing gender and age with sales trends, we gained clarity on which segment contributes the most to revenue.

- In the above visualisation, The Slicer plays a pivotal role(pun intended) in filtering the data dynamically.
- The dashboard includes different charts and diagrams, making the insights visually engaging and easy to interpret.
- The visual representation helps in the decision-making process.
- Even non-technical stakeholders can easily explore the data through quarterly trends.
- The dashboard includes three slicers: Category (Products), Month, and Sales Channels.
     + Amazon ranks as the highest-performing sales channel, significantly contributing to the store's revenue.

<h1><B> CONCLUSION & ASSUMPTION </B></H1>
-The top contributing states are Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, and Karnataka (all metropolitan areas).
-Women contribute more to sales compared to men, accounting for 65\% of total purchases.
-The highest spending demographic is adults aged 30-49, who contribute 50\% of total sales.

ASSUMPTION </B></H1>
There may be missing data variables that could provide deeper insights. If more relevant data points are available, we can refine our understanding further.

<h1><B> SUGGESTION TO THE TEAM</B></H1>
-Targeting female customers in the top three states can lead to significant revenue growth. However, focusing on male customers is also essential, as there is room for improvement.
-To attract male buyers, ads, coupons, and offers should be launched on top-performing channels like Amazon, Myntra, and Flipkart. 
- Marketing strategies should be tailored to engage male shoppers effectively.

Thank you
