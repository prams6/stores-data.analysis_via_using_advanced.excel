Greetings, Respected Person

  Hello, The below Business analysis of the data is on the Vrinda store: which has multiple ecommerce products and these products are been bought by majority of the population contributing to the sales and generating more than the break even point.
  As a business analyst, the data is been browsed and surfed from the perspective to understand the peak points and to evauate those key points to generate more effient desicions leading to awareness in the less active segmented market and hike of revenue.

  <h1><B> DATA MODELLING </B></H1>
  The data was analysed on Excel using advanced tools; Firstly we cleansed the data looking for no duplicates or blank columns, so there are no errors in the furture 
  While there was much understanding about the data, there were two tables; First one being  the table of <B>AGE</B> which had multiple age (numeric or metric value) which would not give a precise statistical calculation and also we had <b>DATE</b> table which we again had to sort efficiently.
  
 <h1><B> DATA PROCESSING </B></H1>
 <p1> <B>BREAKING DOWN INTO METRICS</B></P1>
 
- Categorising the values of the varibale by using <B>[IF FORMULA]</B> in Excel gave a better view and unerstanding of the segment.
- We categorised the data and now have two tables with one being the Age Group Category which we sorted from the age table
- Second; we created the monthly table: through the Date table by using the IF formula
This would make the data more clear, simple to read and accurate during visualising the data.

 <h1><B> DATA ANALYSIS </B></H1>
-To analyse the data; <b>PIVOT TABLE ANALYSIS </b> was the best suitable option to understand the data in the right manner and make desicions which feel exactly right.

To understand the metrics; We formulated a set of questions from the prespective of "HOW" and "WHAT" caused the changes: and below are the following questions and respective answers whch we had found out.

Q1. THE HIGHEST AMOUNT OF SALES AND ORDERS?
Ans: The highest orders were 2900K Orders leading to the sales and revenue generation of amount 2.0 Million

Q2. THE MONTH WHICH HAD THE HIGHEST AMOUNT OF SALES AND ORDERS AND WHICH GENDER SEGMENT CONTRIBUTES THE MOST?
Ans: As we can true the trend analysis , the highest amount of Sales were in the month of March with revenue generation upto 1.95 Million and the more no. of contribution is from the Women side with the <B>PERCENTAGE RATE UPTO 64% </B>

Q3. THE ORDER STATUS: : 92% of the orders are delivered on time, and however the rest 8% holds the cancelled, returned and refunded orders which needs to be addressed aswell

- Through the various questions: We understand for a fact that when we compare the same with the gender and age; we have a clarity on which age and gender contributes the more to the sales:

<h1><B> DATA VISUALISATION </B></H1>

![vrinda store analysis dashboard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bd3afdc-c640-4564-942d-479133235eea)

- In the above visualisation the part of a <B> SLICER </B> plays a very pivotal role [pun intended].
- The visulaisation also has all differnt kinds of diagrams and charts which makes it more intersting and makes the reader feel unique about every perspective
- All the charts add more points to the desicions making process.
- For any non tech leaders it would be easy and a click to check the data through different quarters
- There are three slicers and the values contains Category(Products), Month and Channels

- As we can see in the above Dashboard: Amazon ranks the highest channel or the distributor contributng highly to the Store's revenue or profit rate.

<h1><B> CONCLUSION & ASSUMPTION </B></H1>
-the top contributing states are Maharashtra, Uttarpradesh and Karnataka: Not forgetting that all these are metropolitian states
- Women are more likely to buy compared to men according to the 65\ percentage rate.
- However as we can see that the Adults Contribute the most (30-49 years of age) to the sales (50\%).

ASSUMPTION </B></H1>
However there can also be scenarios where we can might lack some amount of data; but if we can get more inisghts on more data variables or values we can get a more clearer vision.

<h1><B> SUGGESTION TO THE TEAM</B></H1>
-Targetting women customers from the top 3 listed states ; can lead to more growth, However we have to also focus on the men section; Because there is always a room for improvement
-Women are in the for the shopping, However to attract the male community: the initiation of ads, coupons and offers on our top contributing channels (Amazon, Myntra, Flipkart) would be beneficial .
- The ads can be from the perspective to attract the male customers.

Thank you
